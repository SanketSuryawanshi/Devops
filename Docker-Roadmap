Here’s a basic example to help you get started with **Docker Compose**. Docker Compose is useful for setting up and managing multi-container applications.

### Example: A Simple Flask Application with Redis using Docker Compose

Let’s say you have a **Flask** application that connects to a **Redis** service. You want to run both the Flask app and Redis together using Docker Compose.

#### 1. **Project Structure**
Create a folder structure for the project:

```
my_app/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── docker-compose.yml
```

#### 2. **Flask App (`app.py`)**
```python
from flask import Flask
import redis

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.StrictRedis(host='redis', port=6379, decode_responses=True)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = cache.incr('hits')
    return f'Hello! I have been seen {count} times.\n'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", debug=True)
```

#### 3. **Requirements File (`requirements.txt`)**
This is for installing Python dependencies.
```
flask
redis
```

#### 4. **Docker Compose File (`docker-compose.yml`)**
This defines your services (Flask and Redis):
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

#### 5. **Dockerfile**
To create an image for your Flask app, add a `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

#### 6. **Steps to Run**

1. Create the project folder and files as shown above.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my_app
   ```
3. Run **Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

Docker Compose will:
- Build the Flask app image.
- Pull the Redis image.
- Run both services in containers.

#### 7. **Access the Flask App**

Once the containers are up and running, visit:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

The app will connect to the Redis container, and every time you refresh, it will increment and display the count.

#### Docker Compose Commands
- **Start the services:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```
- **Stop the services:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
- **View running containers:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose ps
  ```
- **View logs:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

This example demonstrates how to use Docker Compose for a simple multi-container setup!
