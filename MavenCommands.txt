Maven is a popular build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies the build process by managing dependencies, compiling source code, and packaging artifacts. Here's a list of commonly used Maven commands along with brief descriptions:

1. `mvn clean`:
   - Cleans the project by removing the target directory and all generated files.

2. `mvn compile`:
   - Compiles the source code of the project.

3. `mvn test`:
   - Runs unit tests for the project.

4. `mvn package`:
   - Packages the compiled code and resources into a distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file.

5. `mvn install`:
   - Installs the project's artifacts into the local Maven repository, making them available for other projects to use as dependencies.

6. `mvn deploy`:
   - Deploys the project's artifacts to a remote repository, such as Nexus or Artifactory, making them available for other developers or projects.

7. `mvn site`:
   - Generates project documentation, such as project reports, test reports, and code metrics, into a website format.

8. `mvn clean install`:
   - Cleans the project, compiles the source code, runs tests, and installs the artifacts into the local repository.

9. `mvn clean package`:
   - Cleans the project, compiles the source code, and packages the artifacts without installing them into the local repository.

10. `mvn clean test`:
    - Cleans the project, compiles the source code, and runs tests without packaging or installing the artifacts.

11. `mvn dependency:tree`:
    - Displays the project's dependency tree, showing all dependencies and transitive dependencies.

12. `mvn dependency:resolve`:
    - Resolves dependencies for the project and downloads them to the local repository.

13. `mvn dependency:purge-local-repository`:
    - Removes all dependencies from the local repository.

14. `mvn help:describe`:
    - Displays information about Maven goals, plugins, and their configurations.

15. `mvn archetype:generate`:
    - Generates a new Maven project from an archetype (project template).

These are some of the most commonly used Maven commands. You can find more detailed information about each command and its options in the Maven documentation or by running `mvn --help` to see the available plugins and their goals.
